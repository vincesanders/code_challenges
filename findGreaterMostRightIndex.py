Input a = [21,5,6,56,88,52], output = [5,5,5,4,-1,-1] . Output array values is made up of indices of the element with value greater than the current element but with largest index. So 21 < 56 (index 3), 21 < 88 (index 4) but also 21 < 52 (index 5) so we choose index 5 (value 52). Same applies for 5,6 and for 56 its 88 (index 4). If there is no greater element then use -1 and last element of the array will always have value of -1 in output array since there is no other elment after it. Follow up to consider the input as a stream, how can we only update smaller element (use specific Data structure), running time and space complexity discussion.
